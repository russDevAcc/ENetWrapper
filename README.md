# ENetWrapper
 
Tiny wrapper for [ENet](https://github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp) to make it easier to use and allocation free. There is not any code located in this repository so if the code is needed get it from [here](https://github.com/russDevAcc/com.russdevacc.enetwrapper) or just use the dll files found in release.
